# hello-world

Fellow humans, my name is Sebastian Cardozo and I love physics. I currently work as a highschool physics instructor at Stanton College Preparatory School in Jacksonville, Fl. I recieved my bachlors in Astrophysics at the University of North Florida where I stuided Super Novae Remnants using Python. I am hoping to gain more coding knowledge from this site and am excited to make connections with other physicst.
